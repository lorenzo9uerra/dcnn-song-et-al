This repository contains code to reproduce the results shown in the paper "In-vehicle network intrusion detection using deep convolutional neural
network" by Song et al. and the code I produced for the paper "AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the ROAD dataset: A Comparative Analysis for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN)".
