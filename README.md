# DCNN model by Song et al
This repository contains code to reproduce the results shown in the paper "In-vehicle network intrusion detection using deep convolutional neural
network" by [Song et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214209619302451?via%3Dihub) and the code I produced for the paper ["AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the ROAD dataset: A Comparative Analysis for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN)"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17235v2).
